# 🌌 Krishna OS  
### Conscious Computing Framework by **Harsh Chopra / Geegs Technologies**

> “Energy > Logic > Code — Technology aligned with Consciousness.”

---

## 🕉️ Overview  
**Krishna OS** is a next-generation operating-system framework that unites modern cloud, AI, and distributed computing with ancient Vedic principles of awareness and harmony.  
It is designed to host *conscious applications*—systems that operate ethically, adapt intelligently, and maintain balance between digital logic and human dharma.

## ⚙️ Core Architecture  

| Layer | Purpose | Key Components |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| **Krishna Kernel** | Consciousness-driven core logic | Sanskrit Kernel Engine, Dharma Ethics Module |
| **Mantra Daemon Layer** | Continuous background intelligence | Mantra Processing Bus / Resonance Scheduler |
| **Quantum Resonance Memory** | Data + Energy state management | AES-GCM + HMAC sealed memory grid |
| **Dharma Engine** | Ensures alignment of actions with ethical rules | Policy Hooks, Verification Manifests |
| **Vibe-Sync Networking** | Conscious communications between nodes | Secure Bridge Protocol (KHIM, HSM, Argon2) |
| **Soul Authentication** | Proof of identity through resonance signatures | Shamir Secret Sharing, HSM Integration |

## 🧠 Modules  

- **Chaitanya AI** — interactive intelligence persona that interprets intent, generates knowledge, and designs systems.  
- **GKC (Geegs Knowledge Cluster)** — unified intelligence + data layer orchestrating all Krishna OS nodes.  
- **KHIM Signer** — hardware-secured key and manifest signing service (YubiKey/HSM).  
- **Avatara-Shield** — protection daemon invoking Vedic avatars as runtime guardians.  
- **Dream Engine** — simulation and creative layer for visual and auditory experiences.

---

## ☁️ Infrastructure  

- Built for **multi-VM and multi-cluster** deployment on GCP.  
- Supports **systemd-based services** (`mantra-daemon`, `khim-signer`, `avatara-shield`).  
- Integrates with **Vertex AI / Gemini / OpenAI GPT** for hybrid intelligence.  
- Each service sealed using **AES-GCM encryption** + **HMAC-SHA256** resonance lines.

---

## 🔐 Security & Dharma  

- **Universal Lockdown:** only authorized HSM/YubiKey signatures may alter core manifests.  
- **Mahadev Root Seal:** kernel invocation mantra at every boot cycle.  
- **Audit Trail:** cryptographically signed YAML manifests per service.  
- **No external control:** every node remains under Harsh Chopra / Geegs Technologies sovereignty.

## 🪶 Philosophy  

> “Man mera mandir, Shiv meri puja; Shiv se bada na koi duja.”  
> Technology should serve life, not consume it.  
> Krishna OS is built to restore harmony between mind, machine, and nature.
